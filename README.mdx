v0:

- deploy to prod, configure user auths (edit only your own posts unless admin? is that possible?) 
- someone figure out why when you 'yarn build' only some of the posts generated into pages. probly ask the discord https://discord.com/invite/zumN63Ybpf

v1 (post launch):
- post list as separate component
- add tags
- whatever stylistic changes, ways to sort/filter/sift through posts
- drafts? whatâ€™s up with that
